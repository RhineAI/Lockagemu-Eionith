# Extrude a mesh along a spline

Extrude a mesh along a spline to create shapes such as tubes, wires, ropes, and noodles.  

To refer to a sample scene that demonstrates how the Spline Extrude component can extrude a mesh along a spline, [import the **Extrude Spline and Nearest Point** sample scene](index.md#import-splines-samples).
